# ExerciseTracker
# This application allows the user to track exercises performed with any given set of repetitions and weight, tracking the day of completion.
# The list can be easily updated using the edit icons or an item can be permanently removed using the delete icons.
# The purpose of this application is to wrap up my knowledge in a final project for a web development course I had been taking.
# This project utilizes Javascript, CSS and HTML with a React Framework. The application is separated into its REST API for easy, clean access to the model and controller, whereas
# the view is in a separate file called "movies-ui".
